// Initial Incorrect Code to Fix
// const cookies = ["Oatmeal Raisin", "Chocolate Chip", "Sugar", "Peanut Butter", "Snickerdoodle", "Ginger"]
// let y = 1

// for (let x = 1; y < cookies.length; x++) {
//     const currentCookie = cookies[y]
//     console.log(`Mmmmmmm... that's a good ${currentCookie} cookie`)
// }

// Fixed code
// Probem x was initalized as the index variable, but then y was used as the check for < cookies.length
const cookies = ["Oatmeal Raisin", "Chocolate Chip", "Sugar", "Peanut Butter", "Snickerdoodle", "Ginger"]
// let y = 1

for (let x = 1; x < cookies.length; x++) {
    const currentCookie = cookies[x]
